#. description(perl-Net-Server)
msgid ""
"'Net::Server' is an extensible, generic Perl server engine. 'Net::Server' "
"combines the good properties from 'Net::Daemon' (0.34), 'NetServer::"
"Generic' (1.03), and 'Net::FTPServer' (1.0), and also from various concepts "
"in the Apache Webserver.\n"
"\n"
"'Net::Server' attempts to be a generic server as in 'Net::Daemon' and "
"'NetServer::Generic'. It includes with it the ability to run as an inetd "
"process ('Net::Server::INET'), a single connection server ('Net::Server' or "
"'Net::Server::Single'), a forking server ('Net::Server::Fork'), a preforking "
"server which maintains a constant number of preforked children ('Net::"
"Server::PreForkSimple'), or as a managed preforking server which maintains "
"the number of children based on server load ('Net::Server::PreFork'). In all "
"but the inetd type, the server provides the ability to connect to one or to "
"multiple server ports.\n"
"\n"
"'Net::Server' uses ideologies of 'Net::FTPServer' in order to provide "
"extensibility. The additional server types are made possible via "
"\"personalities\" or sub classes of the 'Net::Server'. By moving the "
"multiple types of servers out of the main 'Net::Server' class, the 'Net::"
"Server' concept is easily extended to other types (in the near future, we "
"would like to add a \"Thread\" personality).\n"
"\n"
"'Net::Server' borrows several concepts from the Apache Webserver. 'Net::"
"Server' uses \"hooks\" to allow custom servers such as SMTP, HTTP, POP3, "
"etc. to be layered over the base 'Net::Server' class. In addition the 'Net::"
"Server::PreFork' class borrows concepts of min_start_servers, max_servers, "
"and min_waiting servers. 'Net::Server::PreFork' also uses the concept of an "
"flock serialized accept when accepting on multiple ports (PreFork can choose "
"between flock, IPC::Semaphore, and pipe to control serialization)."

#. description(perl-Params-Util)
msgid ""
"'Params::Util' provides a basic set of importable functions that makes "
"checking parameters a hell of a lot easier\n"
"\n"
"While they can be (and are) used in other contexts, the main point behind "
"this module is that the functions *both* Do What You Mean, and Do The Right "
"Thing, so they are most useful when you are getting params passed into your "
"code from someone and/or somewhere else and you can't really trust the "
"quality.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, 'Params::Util' is of most use at the edges of your API, where params "
"and data are coming in from outside your code.\n"
"\n"
"The functions provided by 'Params::Util' check in the most strictly correct "
"manner known, are documented as thoroughly as possible so their exact "
"behaviour is clear, and heavily tested so make sure they are not fooled by "
"weird data and Really Bad Things.\n"
"\n"
"To use, simply load the module providing the functions you want to use as "
"arguments (as shown in the SYNOPSIS).\n"
"\n"
"To aid in maintainability, 'Params::Util' will *never* export by default.\n"
"\n"
"You must explicitly name the functions you want to export, or use the ':ALL' "
"param to just have it export everything (although this is not recommended if "
"you have any _FOO functions yourself with which future additions to 'Params::"
"Util' may clash)"

#. description(perl-Apache-AuthCookie)
msgid ""
"*Apache::AuthCookie* allows you to intercept a user's first unauthenticated "
"access to a protected document. The user will be presented with a custom "
"form where they can enter authentication credentials. The credentials are "
"posted to the server where AuthCookie verifies them and returns a session "
"key.\n"
"\n"
"The session key is returned to the user's browser as a cookie. As a cookie, "
"the browser will pass the session key on every subsequent accesses. "
"AuthCookie will verify the session key and re-authenticate the user.\n"
"\n"
"All you have to do is write a custom module that inherits from AuthCookie. "
"Your module is a class which implements two methods:\n"
"\n"
"* 'authen_cred()'\n"
"\n"
"  Verify the user-supplied credentials and return a session key. The   "
"session key can be any string - often you'll use some string containing   "
"username, timeout info, and any other information you need to determine   "
"access to documents, and append a one-way hash of those values together   "
"with some secret key.\n"
"\n"
"* 'authen_ses_key()'\n"
"\n"
"  Verify the session key (previously generated by 'authen_cred()', "
"possibly   during a previous request) and return the user ID. This user ID "
"will be   fed to '$r->connection->user()' to set Apache's idea of who's "
"logged in.\n"
"\n"
"By using AuthCookie versus Apache's built-in AuthBasic you can design your "
"own authentication system. There are several benefits.\n"
"\n"
"* 1.\n"
"\n"
"  The client doesn't *have* to pass the user credentials on every   "
"subsequent access. If you're using passwords, this means that the   password "
"can be sent on the first request only, and subsequent requests   don't need "
"to send this (potentially sensitive) information. This is   known as "
"\"ticket-based\" authentication.\n"
"\n"
"* 2.\n"
"\n"
"  When you determine that the client should stop using the   credentials/"
"session key, the server can tell the client to delete the   cookie. Letting "
"users \"log out\" is a notoriously impossible-to-solve   problem of "
"AuthBasic.\n"
"\n"
"* 3.\n"
"\n"
"  AuthBasic dialog boxes are ugly. You can design your own HTML login "
"forms   when you use AuthCookie.\n"
"\n"
"* 4.\n"
"\n"
"  You can specify the domain of a cookie using PerlSetVar commands. For   "
"instance, if your AuthName is 'WhatEver', you can put the command\n"
"\n"
"   PerlSetVar WhatEverDomain .yourhost.com\n"
"\n"
"  into your server setup file and your access cookies will span all hosts   "
"ending in '.yourhost.com'.\n"
"\n"
"* 5.\n"
"\n"
"  You can optionally specify the name of your cookie using the "
"'CookieName'   directive. For instance, if your AuthName is 'WhatEver', you "
"can put the   command\n"
"\n"
"   PerlSetVar WhatEverCookieName MyCustomName\n"
"\n"
"  into your server setup file and your cookies for this AuthCookie realm   "
"will be named MyCustomName. Default is AuthType_AuthName.\n"
"\n"
"* 6.\n"
"\n"
"  By default users must satisfy ALL of the 'require' directives. If you   "
"want authentication to succeed if ANY 'require' directives are met, use   "
"the 'Satisfy' directive. For instance, if your AuthName is 'WhatEver',   you "
"can put the command\n"
"\n"
"   PerlSetVar WhatEverSatisfy Any\n"
"\n"
"  into your server startup file and authentication for this realm will   "
"succeed if ANY of the 'require' directives are met.\n"
"\n"
"This is the flow of the authentication handler, less the details of the "
"redirects. Two REDIRECT's are used to keep the client from displaying the "
"user's credentials in the Location field. They don't really change "
"AuthCookie's model, but they do add another round-trip request to the "
"client.\n"

#. description(perl-HTML-TableExtract)
msgid ""
"HTML::TableExtract is a subclass of HTML::Parser that serves to extract the "
"information from tables of interest contained within an HTML document. The "
"information from each extracted table is stored in table objects. Tables can "
"be extracted as text, HTML, or HTML::ElementTable structures (for in-place "
"editing or manipulation).\n"
"\n"
"There are currently four constraints available to specify which tables you "
"would like to extract from a document: _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, and "
"_Attributes_.\n"
"\n"
"_Headers_, the most flexible and adaptive of the techniques, involves "
"specifying text in an array that you expect to appear above the data in the "
"tables of interest. Once all headers have been located in a row of that "
"table, all further cells beneath the columns that matched your headers are "
"extracted. All other columns are ignored: think of it as vertical slices "
"through a table. In addition, TableExtract automatically rearranges each row "
"in the same order as the headers you provided. If you would like to disable "
"this, set _automap_ to 0 during object creation, and instead rely on the "
"column_map() method to find out the order in which the headers were found. "
"Furthermore, TableExtract will automatically compensate for cell span issues "
"so that columns are really the same columns as you would visually see in a "
"browser. This behavior can be disabled by setting the _gridmap_ parameter to "
"0. HTML is stripped from the entire textual content of a cell before header "
"matches are attempted -- unless the _keep_html_ parameter was enabled.\n"
"\n"
"_Depth_ and _Count_ are more specific ways to specify tables in relation to "
"one another. _Depth_ represents how deeply a table resides in other tables. "
"The depth of a top-level table in the document is 0. A table within a top-"
"level table has a depth of 1, and so on. Each depth can be thought of as a "
"layer; tables sharing the same depth are on the same layer. Within each of "
"these layers, _Count_ represents the order in which a table was seen at that "
"depth, starting with 0. Providing both a _depth_ and a _count_ will uniquely "
"specify a table within a document.\n"
"\n"
"_Attributes_ match based on the attributes of the html <table> tag, for "
"example, boder widths or background color.\n"
"\n"
"Each of the _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, and _Attributes_ specifications are "
"cumulative in their effect on the overall extraction. For instance, if you "
"specify only a _Depth_, then you get all tables at that depth (note that "
"these could very well reside in separate higher- level tables throughout the "
"document since depth extends across tables). If you specify only a _Count_, "
"then the tables at that _Count_ from all depths are returned (i.e., the "
"_n_th occurrence of a table at each depth). If you only specify _Headers_, "
"then you get all tables in the document containing those column headers. If "
"you have specified multiple constraints of _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, and "
"_Attributes_, then each constraint has veto power over whether a particular "
"table is extracted.\n"
"\n"
"If no _Headers_, _Depth_, _Count_, or _Attributes_ are specified, then all "
"tables match.\n"
"\n"
"When extracting only text from tables, the text is decoded with HTML::"
"Entities by default; this can be disabled by setting the _decode_ parameter "
"to 0."

#. description(perl-Encode-Locale)
msgid ""
"In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it "
"processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still "
"byte based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the "
"program from the outside and encode them again on the way out.\n"
"\n"
"The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions "
"requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output. "
"The 'Encode::Locale' module looks up the charset and encoding (called a "
"CODESET in the locale jargon) and arranges for the the Encode manpage module "
"to know this encoding under the name \"locale\". It means bytes obtained "
"from the environment can be converted to Unicode strings by calling 'Encode::"
"encode(locale => $bytes)' and converted back again with 'Encode::decode"
"(locale => $string)'.\n"
"\n"
"Where file systems interfaces pass file names in and out of the program we "
"also need care. The trend is for operating systems to use a fixed file "
"encoding that don't actually depend on the locale; and this module "
"determines the most appropriate encoding for file names. The the Encode "
"manpage module will know this encoding under the name \"locale_fs\". For "
"traditional Unix systems this will be an alias to the same encoding as "
"\"locale\".\n"
"\n"
"For programs running in a terminal window (called a \"Console\" on some "
"systems) the \"locale\" encoding is usually a good choice for what to expect "
"as input and output. Some systems allows us to query the encoding set for "
"the terminal and 'Encode::Locale' will do that if available and make these "
"encodings known under the 'Encode' aliases \"console_in\" and \"console_out"
"\". For systems where we can't determine the terminal encoding these will be "
"aliased as the same encoding as \"locale\". The advice is to use \"console_in"
"\" for input known to come from the terminal and \"console_out\" for output "
"known to go from the terminal.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to arranging for various Encode aliases the following functions "
"and variables are provided:\n"
"\n"
"* decode_argv( )\n"
"\n"
"* decode_argv( Encode::FB_CROAK )\n"
"\n"
"  This will decode the command line arguments to perl (the '@ARGV' array)   "
"in-place.\n"
"\n"
"  The function will by default replace characters that can't be decoded by   "
"\"\\x{FFFD}\", the Unicode replacement character.\n"
"\n"
"  Any argument provided is passed as CHECK to underlying Encode::decode()   "
"call. Pass the value 'Encode::FB_CROAK' to have the decoding croak if not   "
"all the command line arguments can be decoded. See the Encode/\"Handling   "
"Malformed Data\" manpage for details on other options for CHECK.\n"
"\n"
"* env( $uni_key )\n"
"\n"
"* env( $uni_key => $uni_value )\n"
"\n"
"  Interface to get/set environment variables. Returns the current value as   "
"a Unicode string. The $uni_key and $uni_value arguments are expected to   be "
"Unicode strings as well. Passing 'undef' as $uni_value deletes the   "
"environment variable named $uni_key.\n"
"\n"
"  The returned value will have the characters that can't be decoded   "
"replaced by \"\\x{FFFD}\", the Unicode replacement character.\n"
"\n"
"  There is no interface to request alternative CHECK behavior as for   "
"decode_argv(). If you need that you need to call encode/decode yourself.   "
"For example:\n"
"\n"
"      my $key = Encode::encode(locale => $uni_key, Encode::FB_CROAK);       "
"my $uni_value = Encode::decode(locale => $ENV{$key}, Encode::FB_CROAK);\n"
"\n"
"* reinit( )\n"
"\n"
"* reinit( $encoding )\n"
"\n"
"  Reinitialize the encodings from the locale. You want to call this   "
"function if you changed anything in the environment that might influence   "
"the locale.\n"
"\n"
"  This function will croak if the determined encoding isn't recognized by   "
"the Encode module.\n"
"\n"
"  With argument force $ENCODING_... variables to set to the given value.\n"
"\n"
"* $ENCODING_LOCALE\n"

"Log::Log4perl lets you remote-control and fine-tune the logging behaviour of "
"your system from the outside. It implements the widely popular (Java-based) "
"Log4j logging package in pure Perl.\n"
"\n"
"*For a detailed tutorial on Log::Log4perl usage, please read*\n"
"\n"
"    http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/log4perl.html\n"
"\n"
"Logging beats a debugger if you want to know what's going on in your code "
"during runtime. However, traditional logging packages are too static and "
"generate a flood of log messages in your log files that won't help you.\n"
"\n"
"'Log::Log4perl' is different. It allows you to control the number of logging "
"messages generated at three different levels:\n"
"\n"
"* *\n"
"\n"
"  At a central location in your system (either in a configuration file or   "
"in the startup code) you specify _which components_ (classes, functions)   "
"of your system should generate logs.\n"
"\n"
"* *\n"
"\n"
"  You specify how detailed the logging of these components should be by   "
"specifying logging _levels_.\n"
"\n"
"* *\n"
"\n"
"  You also specify which so-called _appenders_ you want to feed your log   "
"messages to (\"Print it to the screen and also append it to /tmp/my.log\")   "
"and which format (\"Write the date first, then the file name and line   "
"number, and then the log message\") they should be in.\n"
"\n"
"This is a very powerful and flexible mechanism. You can turn on and off your "
"logs at any time, specify the level of detail and make that dependent on the "
"subsystem that's currently executed.\n"
"\n"
"Let me give you an example: You might find out that your system has a "
"problem in the 'MySystem::Helpers::ScanDir' component. Turning on detailed "
"debugging logs all over the system would generate a flood of useless log "
"messages and bog your system down beyond recognition. With 'Log::Log4perl', "
"however, you can tell the system: \"Continue to log only severe errors to "
"the log file. Open a second log file, turn on full debug logs in the "
"'MySystem::Helpers::ScanDir' component and dump all messages originating "
"from there into the new log file\". And all this is possible by just "
"changing the parameters in a configuration file, which your system can re-"
"read even while it's running!"

"modified to skip all package names matching the pattern given in the \"use\" "
"statement inside the \"'qw()'\" term (or argument list).\n"
"\n"
"Suppose you have a family of modules or classes named \"Pack::A\", \"Pack::B"
"\" and so on, and each of them uses \"'Carp::Clan qw(^Pack::);'\" (or at "
"least the one in which the error or warning gets raised).\n"
"\n"
"Thus when for example your script \"tool.pl\" calls module \"Pack::A\", and "
"module \"Pack::A\" calls module \"Pack::B\", an exception raised in module "
"\"Pack::B\" will appear to have originated in \"tool.pl\" where \"Pack::A\" "
"was called, and not in \"Pack::A\" where \"Pack::B\" was called, as the "
"unmodified \"'Carp.pm'\" would try to make you believe ':-)'.\n"
"\n"
"This works similarly if \"Pack::B\" calls \"Pack::C\" where the exception is "
"raised, etcetera.\n"
"\n"
"In other words, this blames all errors in the \"'Pack::*'\" modules on the "
"user of these modules, i.e., on you. ';-)'\n"
"\n"
"The skipping of a clan (or family) of packages according to a pattern "
"describing its members is necessary in cases where these modules are not "
"classes derived from each other (and thus when examining '@ISA' - as in the "
"original \"'Carp.pm'\" module - doesn't help).\n"
"\n"
"The purpose and advantage of this is that a \"clan\" of modules can work "
"together (and call each other) and throw exceptions at various depths down "
"the calling hierarchy and still appear as a monolithic block (as though they "
"were a single module) from the perspective of the caller.\n"
"\n"
"In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the module in "
"which you \"'use Carp::Clan'\", i.e., if you want to make all error messages "
"or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this "
"is what you usually used to \"'use Carp;'\" for ';-)'), instead of in your "
"module itself (which is what you can do with a \"die\" or \"warn\" anyway), "
"you do not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically provide "
"the correct one for you.\n"
"\n"
"I.e., just \"'use Carp::Clan;'\" without any arguments and call \"carp\" or "
"\"croak\" as appropriate, and they will automatically defend your module "
"against all blames!\n"
"\n"
"In other words, a pattern is only necessary if you want to make several "
"modules (more than one) work together and appear as though they were only "
"one.\n"
"\n"
"Forcing a Stack Trace     As a debugging aid, you can force \"'Carp::Clan'\" "
"to treat a \"croak\" as     a \"confess\" and a \"carp\" as a \"cluck\". In "
"other words, force a detailed     stack trace to be given. This can be very "
"helpful when trying to     understand why, or from where, a warning or error "
"is being generated.\n"
"\n"
"    This feature is enabled either by \"importing\" the non-existent "
"symbol     'verbose', or by setting the global variable \"'$Carp::Clan::"
"Verbose'\"     to a true value.\n"
"\n"
"    You would typically enable it by saying\n"
"\n"
"        use Carp::Clan qw(verbose);\n"

"    Note that you can both specify a \"family pattern\" and the string     "
"\"verbose\" inside the \"'qw()'\" term (or argument list) of the \"use\"     "
