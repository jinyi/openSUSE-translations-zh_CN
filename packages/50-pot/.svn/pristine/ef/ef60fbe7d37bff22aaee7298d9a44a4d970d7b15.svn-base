#. description(python-virtualenv)
msgid ""
"virtualenv is a tool to create isolated Python environments. The basic "
"problem being addressed is one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly "
"permissions. Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, "
"but another application requires version 2. How can you use both these "
"applications? If you install everything into /usr/lib/python2.4/site-"
"packages (or whatever your platforms standard location is), its easy to end "
"up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that "
"shouldnt be upgraded.\n"
"\n"
"Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it "
"be? If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of "
"those libraries can break the application.\n"
"\n"
"Also, what if you cant install packages into the global site-packages "
"directory? For instance, on a shared host.\n"
"\n"
"In all these cases, virtualenv can help you. It creates an environment that "
"has its own installation directories, that doesnt share libraries with other "
"virtualenv environments (and optionally doesnt use the globally installed "
"libraries either)."
