#. description(convmv)
msgid ""
"convmv is meant to help convert a directory tree and the contained files or "

"also takes care of symlinks and converts the symlink target pointer in case "
"the symlink target is converted.\n"
"\n"
"All this comes in very handy when converting from old 8-bit locales to UTF-8 "
"locales. It is also possible to convert directories to UTF-8 that are "
"already partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain files are "
"UTF-8 encoded and skips them by default. To turn this behavior off, use the "
"--nosmart switch.\n"
"\n"
"An interoperability issue that comes with UTF-8 locales is this: Linux and "
"(most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the normalization form C (NFC) "
"for UTF-8 encoding by default but do not enforce this. Darwin, the base of "
"Macintosh OSX, enforces normalization form D (NFD), where a few characters "
"are encoded in a different way. convmv is able to convert files to NFC or "
"NFD, which aids in interoperability with such systems."
