"archive. However, the API also provides extreme    flexibility with regards "

"author decided to take the commercial route and the database froze at the "

"database grew, thanks to PTLens author which gave his permission for this, "
"while the code was totally rewritten from scratch (and the database was "
"converted to a totally new, XML-based format).\n"
