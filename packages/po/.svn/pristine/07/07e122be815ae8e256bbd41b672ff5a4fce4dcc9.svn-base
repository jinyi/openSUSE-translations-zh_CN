#. description(perl-aliased)
msgid ""
"'aliased' is simple in concept but is a rather handy module. It loads the class you specify and exports into your namespace a subroutine that returns the class name. You can explicitly alias the class to another name or, if you prefer, you can do so implicitly. In the latter case, the name of the subroutine is the last part of the class name. Thus, it does something similar to the following:\n"
"\n"
"  \n"
"\n"
"  use Some::Annoyingly::Long::Module::Name::Customer;   sub Customer {     return 'Some::Annoyingly::Long::Module::Name::Customer';   }   my $cust = Customer->new;\n"
"\n"
"This module is useful if you prefer a shorter name for a class. It's also handy if a class has been renamed.\n"
"\n"
"(Some may object to the term \"aliasing\" because we're not aliasing one namespace to another, but it's a handy term. Just keep in mind that this is done with a subroutine and not with typeglobs and weird namespace munging.)\n"
"\n"
"Note that this is *only* for 'use'ing OO modules. You cannot use this to load procedural modules. See the Why OO Only? section. Also, don't let the version number fool you. This code is ridiculously simple and is just fine for most use."

"QXmpp is pretty intuitive and easy to use. It uses Qt extensively. Qt is the only third party library it is dependent on. Users need to a have working knowledge of C++ and Qt basics (Signals and Slots and Qt data types). The underlying TCP socket and the XMPP RFCs (RFC3920 and RFC3921) have been encapsulated into classes and functions. Therefore the user would not be bothered with these details. But it is always recommended to the advanced users to read and enjoy the low level details."

Various software relies on an always resolvable local host name. When using dynamic hostnames this is usually achieved by patching /etc/hosts at the same time as changing the host name. This however is not ideal since it requires a writable /etc file system and is fragile because the file might be edited by the administrator at the same time. nss-myhostname simply returns all locally configured public IP addresses, or -- if none are configured -- the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (wich is on the local loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host) for whatever system hostname is configured locally. Patching /etc/hosts is thus no longer necessary.\n"
