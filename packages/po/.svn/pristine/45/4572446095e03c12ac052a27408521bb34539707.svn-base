"Apache Ant is a Java-based build tool. In theory, it is kind of like Make, "
"but without Make's wrinkles.\n"
"\n"
"Why another build tool when there is already make, gnumake, nmake, jam, and "
"others? Because all those tools have limitations that Ant's original author "
"could not live with when developing software across multiple platforms. Make-"
"like tools are inherently shell-based--they evaluate a set of dependencies "
"then execute commands, not unlike what you would issue in a shell. This "
"means that you can easily extend these tools by using or writing any program "
"for the OS that you are working on. However, this also means that you limit "
"yourself to the OS, or at least the OS type, such as Unix, that you are "
"working on.\n"
"\n"
"Makefiles are inherently evil as well. Anybody who has worked on them for "
"any time has run into the dreaded tab problem. \"Is my command not executing "
"because I have a space in front of my tab???\" said the original author of "
"Ant way too many times. Tools like Jam took care of this to a great degree, "
"but still have yet another format to use and remember.\n"
"\n"
"Ant is different. Instead of a model where it is extended with shell-based "
"commands, Ant is extended using Java classes. Instead of writing shell "
"commands, the configuration files are XML-based, calling out a target tree "
"where various tasks are executed. Each task is run by an object that "
"implements a particular task interface.\n"
"\n"
"Granted, this removes some of the expressive power that is inherent by being "
"able to construct a shell command such as `find . -name foo -exec rm {}`, "
"but it gives you the ability to be cross-platform--to work anywhere and "
"everywhere. If you really need to execute a shell command, Ant has an <exec> "
"task that allows different commands to be executed based on the OS used."

"The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of the "

"\n"
"With mod_perl, it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl. The "

"starting an external interpreter and the penalty of Perl start-up time.\n"
"\n"
"Note that you do not need mod_perl to run perl scripts via the common "
"gateway interface (CGI). mod_perl enables you to run Perl scripts in an "
"embedded interpreter if the additional performance is needed, but may "
"require modifications to the scripts.\n"
"\n"
"Usage:\n"
"\n"
"To load the module into Apache, run the command \"a2enmod perl\" as root.\n"
"\n"
"To learn about the configuration, the best reference unequivocally is http://"
"perl.apache.org/docs/\n"
"\n"
"For porting 1.0 applications to 2.0, the page http://perl.apache.org/"
"docs/2.0/user/porting/compat.html should give the required information.\n"
"\n"
"Most mod_perl handlers use the perl-script handler. Scripts can run in "
"\"mod_perl mode\" (preconfigured for URLs starting with /perl/) or \"perl "
"cgi mode\" (preconfigured for URLs starting /cgi-perl). Plain CGI scripts "
"can be run via /cgi-bin/. In all these cases, the script would be placed "

"mod_python allows embedding Python within the Apache HTTP server for a "

"\n"
"Apache processes requests in stages (for example: read the request, parse "
"headers, check access, and so on). These stages can be implemented by "
"functions called handlers. Traditionally, handlers are written in C and "
"compiled into Apache modules. mod_python provides a way to extend Apache "
"functionality by writing Apache handlers in Python. For a detailed "
"description of the Apache request processing process, see the Apache API "
"notes.\n"
"\n"
"For most programmers, the request and the authentication handlers provide "
"everything required. To ease migration from CGI and Httpdapy, two handlers "
"are provided that simulate these environments, allowing a user to run "
"scripts under mod_python with (for the most part) no changes to the code.\n"
"\n"
"mod_python originated from a project called Httpdapy. For a long time, "
"Httpdapy was not called mod_python because Httpdapy was not meant to be "
"Apache-specific. Httpdapy was designed to be cross-platform and was "
"initially written for the Netscape server.\n"
"\n"
"Usage Hints:\n"
"\n"
"To load mod_python into Apache, add it to APACHE_MODULES in /etc/sysconfig/"
