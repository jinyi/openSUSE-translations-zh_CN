"After installing texlive and the package texlive-latex, find a large selection of documentation for TeX, LaTeX, and various layout styles in /usr/share/texmf/doc.\n"
"\n"
"TeX (pronounced tech) is an interpreter for text formatting and was developed by Donald E. Knuth.  It works with control and macro commands on a text file. Working with TeX is similar to typesetting methods. LaTeX is a complex macro package that removes the cryptical TeX interface and does most of the work for the user.\n"
"\n"
"TeX uses special fonts produced by the MetaFont program. Various printer drivers and an X11 viewer are also included in this package. The teTeX package is based on the standard TeX package of Karl Berry, which makes configuration much easier. It is also possible to use PostScript fonts. A real PostScript printer is required, however. If the ghostscript (gs) package is installed, all drivers for printing and viewing can use these fonts. Note, however, that the fonts included in the ghostscript package are not identical to Adobe's PostScript fonts. The copyright prohibids us to include them on the CD.\n"
"\n"
"Besides these features, the programs MakeIndex (for producing indexes) and BibTeX (for literature data processing) exist.\n"

"The texlive package includes a full texmf tree, many programs like tex, dvips, etc., shell script configuration, and a big collection of documentations. This package is easily configured by the script texconfig and has multilanguage options."

"Zero Install is a decentralised installation system (there is no central repository; all packages are identified by URLs), loosly-coupled (if different programs require different versions of a library then both versions are installed in parallel, without conflicts), and has an emphasis on security (all package descriptions are GPG-signed, and contain cryptographic hashes of the contents of each version). Each version of each program is stored in its own sub-directory within the Zero Install cache (nothing is installed to directories outside of the cache, such as /usr/bin) and no code from the package is run during install or uninstall. The system can automatically check for updates when software is run."

#. description(velocity)
msgid "Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in Java code. When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or PHP. Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more information on XML transformations) from templates. It can be used either as a standalone utility for generating source code and reports, or as an integrated component of other systems. Velocity also provides template services for the Turbine web application framework. Velocity+Turbine provides a template service that will allow web applications to be developed according to a true MVC model."

XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans keeps full XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model.\n"

"XOM is designed to be easy to learn and easy to use. It works very straight-forwardly, and has a very shallow learning curve. Assuming you're already familiar with XML, you should be able to get up and running with XOM very quickly.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is the only XML API that makes no compromises on correctness. XOM only accepts namespace well-formed XML documents, and only allows you to create namespace well-formed XML documents. (In fact, it's a little stricter than that: it actually guarantees that all documents are round-trippable and have well-defined XML infosets.) XOM manages your XML so you don't have to. With XOM, you can focus on the unique value of your application, and trust XOM to get the XML right.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is fairly unique in that it is a dual streaming/tree-based API. Individual nodes in the tree can be processed while the document is still being built. The enables XOM programs to operate almost as fast as the underlying parser can supply data. You don't need to wait for the document to be completely parsed before you can start working with it.\n"
"\n"
"XOM is very memory efficient. If you read an entire document into memory, XOM uses as little memory as possible. More importantly, XOM allows you to filter documents as they're built so you don't have to build the parts of the tree you aren't interested in. For instance, you can skip building text nodes that only represent boundary white space, if such white space is not significant in your application. You can even process a document piece by piece and throw away each piece when you're done with it. XOM has been used to process documents that are gigabytes in size.\n"
