With IRC being one of the fundamental methods of communication within the open source community, it is bizzare that this area has been neglected.\n"

As such, XChat-GNOME was born, and is gaining popularity as an IRC client for people who care more about chatting than tweaking settings. If anyone is interested in helping out with the project, stop by #xchat-gnome on irc.freenode.net."

XMLBeans uses XML Schema to compile Java interfaces and classes that you can then use to access and modify XML instance data. Using XMLBeans is similar to using any other Java interface/class, you will see things like getFoo or setFoo just as you would expect when working with Java. While a major use of XMLBeans is to access your XML instance data with strongly typed Java classes there are also API's that allow you access to the full XML infoset (XMLBeans keeps full XML Infoset fidelity) as well as to allow you to reflect into the XML schema itself through an XML Schema Object model."

This is particularly true when virtual machines are owned by mutually untrusting users. Secondly, it is necessary to support a variety of different operating systems to accommodate the heterogeneity of popular applications. Thirdly, the performance overhead introduced by virtualization should be small.\n"

"The Xen hypervisor (microkernel) does not provide device drivers for your hardware (except for CPU and memory). This job is left to the kernel that's running in domain 0. Thus the domain 0 kernel is privileged; it has full hardware access. It's started immediately after Xen starts up. Other domains have no access to the hardware; instead they use virtual interfaces that are provided by Xen (with the help of the domain 0 kernel).\n"

"Xen does support booting other Operating Systems; ports of NetBSD (Christian Limpach), FreeBSD (Kip Macy), and Plan 9 (Ron Minnich) exist. A port of Windows XP was developed for an earlier version of Xen, but is not available for release due to license restrictions."
