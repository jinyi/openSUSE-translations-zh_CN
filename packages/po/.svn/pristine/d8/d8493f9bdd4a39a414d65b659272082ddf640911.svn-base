"*Config::Crontab* provides an object-oriented interface to Vixie-style crontab(5) files for Perl.\n"
"\n"
"A *Config::Crontab* object allows you to manipulate an ordered set of\n"
"*Event*, *Env*, or *Comment* objects (also included with this package). Descriptions of these packages may be found below.\n"
"\n"
"In short, *Config::Crontab* reads and writes crontab(5) files (and does a little pretty-printing too) using objects. The general idea is that you create a *Config::Crontab* object and associate it with a file (if unassociated, it will work over a pipe to 'crontab -l'). From there, you can add lines to your crontab object, change existing line attributes, and write everything back to file.\n"
"\n"
"Now, to successfully navigate the module's ins and outs, we'll need a little terminology lesson."

"On the Voodoo 1 the driver uses a shadow buffer in system memory as the video adapter has only 3D acceleration. Selected portions of the shadow framebuffer are copied out to the Voodoo board at the right time. Because of this, the speed of the driver is very dependent on the CPU. Processors nowadays are actually rather fast at moving data so we get very good speed anyway as the shadow framebuffer is in cached RAM.\n"
"\n"
"The Voodoo2 has 16bpp acceleration and the driver provides accelerated versions of most operations except angled lines and stipples. Accelerated alpha blending with the Render extension is also supported as is DGA.\n"
"\n"
"This driver supports 16bpp modes currently. The video hardware supports image conversion from 24bpp to 16bpp but the hardware is 16bpp only.\n"
"\n"
"The Voodoo 1 series cards can go up to 800x600 resolution while the Voodoo 2 can reach 1024x768 providing it has at least 2Mb of frame buffer memory. 1024x768 2D mode does not require two cards configured in scan-line interleave mode (SLI).\n"
"\n"
"Multihead and Xinerama configurations are supported. SLI configurations will be treated as multiple video cards.\n"
"\n"
"Limited support for DPMS screen saving is available. The \"standby\" and \"suspend\" modes are just painting the screen black. The \"off\" mode turns the Voodoo board off and thus works correctly.\n"
"\n"
"This driver does not support a virtual screen size different from the display size. This is a hardware limitation. 3D rendering is also not supported."
