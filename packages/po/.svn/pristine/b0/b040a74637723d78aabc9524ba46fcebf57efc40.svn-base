"Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java objects and methods from scripting languages.

In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language engines.\n"

In short: BeanShell is dynamically interpreted Java, plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say that in many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is embeddable--you can call BeanShell from your Java applications to execute Java code dynamically at runtime or to provide scripting extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your Java applications and objects from BeanShell, working with Java objects and APIs dynamically.

Such objects can be read from an existing file, be transformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to a file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library (BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files.  BCEL is already being used successfully in several projects such as compilers, optimizers, obsfuscators and analysis tools, the most popular probably being the Xalan XSLT processor at Apache."

Every single one of those macros can be re-used without imposing any restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the generated `configure` script. In particular, it is possible to use all those macros in `configure` scripts that are meant for non-free software. This policy is unusual for a Free Software Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that software ought to be free, and software licenses like the GPL are specifically designed to ensure that derivative work based on free software must be free as well. In case of Autoconf, however, an exception has been made, because Autoconf is at such a pivotal position in the software development tool chain that the benefits from having this tool available as widely as possible outweigh the disadvantage that some authors may choose to use it, too, for proprietary software."

"convmv is meant to help convert a directory tree and the contained files or a whole file system into a different encoding. It just converts the file names, not the content of the files. A special feature of convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks and converts the symlink target pointer in case the symlink target is converted.\n"
"\n"
"All this comes in very handy when converting from old 8-bit locales to UTF-8 locales. It is also possible to convert directories to UTF-8 that are already partly UTF-8 encoded. convmv is able to detect if certain files are UTF-8 encoded and skips them by default. To turn this behavior off, use the --nosmart switch.\n"
"\n"
"An interoperability issue that comes with UTF-8 locales is this: Linux and (most?) other Unix-like operating systems use the normalization form C (NFC) for UTF-8 encoding by default but do not enforce this. Darwin, the base of Macintosh OSX, enforces normalization form D (NFD), where a few characters are encoded in a different way. convmv is able to convert files to NFC or NFD, which aids in interoperability with such systems."
