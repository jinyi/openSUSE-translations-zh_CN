"Libarchive is a programming library that can create and read several different streaming archive formats, including most popular tar variants and several cpio formats. It can also write shar archives and read ISO9660 CDROM images. The bsdtar program is an implementation of tar(1) that is built on top of libarchive. It started as a test harness, but has grown and is now the standard system tar for FreeBSD 5 and 6.\n"
"\n"
"The libarchive library offers a number of features that make it both very flexible and very powerful.\n"
"\n"
"- Automatic format detection: libarchive can automatically determine    both the compression and the archive format, regardless of the    data source. Most tar implementations do not automatically detect    the compression format, few implementation that can correctly do    this when reading from stdin or a socket. (The tar program    included with Gunnar Ritter's heirloom collection also does full    automatic format detection.)\n"
"\n"
"- Writes POSIX formats: libarchive writes POSIX-standard formats,    including \"ustar,\" \"pax interchange format,\" and the POSIX \"cpio\"    format.\n"
"\n"
"- Supports pax interchange format: Pax interchange format (which,    despite the name, is really an extended tar format) eliminates    almost all limitations of historic tar formats and provides a    standard method for incorporating vendor-specific extensions.    libarchive exploits this extension mechanism to support ACLs and    file flags, for example. (Joerg Schilling's star archiver is    another open-source tar program that supports pax interchange    format.)\n"
"\n"
"- Reads popular formats: libarchive can read GNU tar, ustar, pax    interchange format, cpio, and older tar variants. The internal    architecture is easily extensible. The only requirement for    support is that it be possible to read the format without seeking    in the file. (For example, a format that includes a compressed    size field before the data cannot be correctly written without    seeking.)\n"
"\n"
"- High-Level API: the libarchive API makes it fairly simple to build    an archive from a list of filenames or to extract the entries    from an archive. However, the API also provides extreme    flexibility with regards to data sources. For example, there are    generic hooks that allow you to write an archive to a socket or    read data from an archive entry into a memory buffer.\n"
"\n"
"- Extensible. The internal design uses generic interfaces for compression, archive format detection and decoding, and archive data I/O. It should be very easy to add new formats, new compression methods, or new ways of reading/writing archives."

"Because the direct use of GnuPG from an application can be a complicated programming task, it is suggested that all software should try to use GPGME instead. This way bug fixes or improvements can be done at a central place and every application benefits from this. Authors of MUAs should especially consider using GPGME. Creating a set of standard widgets for common key selection tasks is even planned."

"\n"
"In the default lossless mode WavPack acts just like a WinZip compressor for audio files. However, unlike MP3 or WMA encoding which can affect the sound quality, not a single bit of the original information is lost, so there's no chance of degradation. This makes lossless mode ideal for archiving audio material or any other situation where quality is paramount. The compression ratio depends on the source material, but generally is between 30% and 70%.\n"
"\n"
"The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless compression with an additional bonus. Instead of creating a single file, this mode creates both a relatively small, high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself, and a \"correction\" file that (when combined with the lossy file) provides full lossless restoration. For some users this means never having to choose between lossless and lossy compression!"
