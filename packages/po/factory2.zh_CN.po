"Allerta is an open source typeface designed for use in signage. Allerta was "
"designed to be easily and quickly read from a distance. Each letter exploits "

"be easily distinguished from any other.\n"
"\n"
"Allerta has been released as an open source project so that those countries, "
"communities, and/or organizations without a proper signage system may have a "
"way of quickly designing and implementing one. While Allerta is complete "
"with a large character set, because it is open source, modification and "
"expansion is encouraged.\n"
"\n"
"For the more urgent of circumstances, Allerta Stencil and an accompanying "
"kit have been designed so that signage can be created with nothing more than "
"the kit of letters, a can of spray paint, and the nearest available "
"substrate. Although the stencil kit may allude the finer points of "
"typographic spacing, it is intended to serve the most basic purpose of "
"signage: guiding people towards their destination or towards assistance.\n"
"\n"
"The name Allerta is derived from the origins of the word alert (adj. swift, "
"v. to advise or warn). The Italian origin all'erta literally means on the "
"lookout.\n"

msgid ""
"Andrew Morton originally developed a set of scripts for maintaining kernel "
"patches outside of any SCM tool. Others extended these into a suite called "
"quilt. The basic idea behind quilt is to maintain patches instead of "
"maintaining source files. Patches can be added, removed or reordered, and "
"they can be refreshed as you fix bugs or update to a new base revision. "
"quilt is very powerful, but it is not integrated with the underlying SCM "
"tools. This makes it difficult to visualize your changes.\n"
"\n"
"Guilt allows one to use quilt functionality on top of a Git repository. "
"Changes are maintained as patches which are committed into Git. Commits can "
"be removed or reordered, and the underlying patch can be refreshed based on "
"changes made in the working directory. The patch directory can also be "
"placed under revision control, so you can have a separate history of changes "
"made to your patches."
