"This version of the Image Scan for Linux software contains only the free "

"\n"
"In particular this version of the Image Scan for Linux software neither "
"contains any proprietary driver library nor firmware files nor proprietary "
"software to support scanner network interfaces nor the proprietary \"libesmod"
"\" library which would be required by the \"/usr/bin/iscan\" frontend which "
"is also not provided.\n"
"\n"
"This package contains only the epkowa driver for SANE, which compiles and "
"runs natively even on non-i386 platforms. For documentation, see \"man sane-"
"epkowa\".\n"
"\n"
"The frontend /usr/bin/iscan was removed because it requires the proprietary "
"\"libesmod\" library. This should cause no problem because the driver epkowa "
"in this version of the Image Scan for Linux software runs natively even on "

"can be used even on non-i386 platforms.\n"
"\n"
"Drawbacks:\n"
"\n"
"The free version of the epkowa driver cannot work for those scanners that "
"require a proprietary driver library (and a firmware file). As of this "
"writing (June 2010), those scanners are the following models:\n"
"\n"
"ES-D400, GT-1500, GT-7200U, GT-7300U, GT-9400UF, GT-D1000, GT-F500, GT-F520, "

"CX5600, Stylus DX4400\n"
"\n"
"Those models do not work with the free iscan version. The third-party Image "
"Scan driver software from Avasys is required for those models. The Image "
"Scan driver software is made and provided by Avasys at http://avasys.jp/eng/"
"linux_driver/ where RPM packages for 32-bit (i386) and 64-bit (x86_64) "
"architecture can be downloaded (provided you accept the Avasys and Epson "
"license agreements). The Image Scan driver from Avasys contains proprietary "
"binary-only software. For some models it is only available for 32-bit (i386) "
"architecture which does not work when you have a 64-bit system installation. "
"Some scanners are also supported by another (free-software) driver. When "
"your scanner model requires a non-free (proprietary) module, you have to "
"download and install two packages from Avasys: The 'iscan' package for the "
"base software and an additional model dependant 'iscan-plugin' package with "
"the proprietary module.\n"
"\n"
"Other scanners may only work via USB but require a proprietary software "
"package which supports the network interface. As of this writing (June "
"2010), those scanners are the following models:\n"
"\n"
"Artisan 710 Series, Artisan 810 Series, EP-702A, EP-802A, EP-902A, ES-H7200, "
"GT-20000, PX-602F, Stylus Office BX610FW Series, Stylus Office TX610FW "

"PX810FW Series, Stylus Photo TX650 Series, Stylus Photo TX710W Series, "
"Stylus SX610FW Series, WorkForce 610 Series\n"
"\n"
"To use those models via the network interface, you need the above mentioned "
"third-party Image Scan driver software from Avasys plus an additional iscan-"
"network-nt package from Avasys which provides support for the network "
"interface.\n"
"\n"
"Note that the iscan-network-nt package from Avasys does not provide support "
"for the network interface for all models. As of this writing (June 2010), "
"the network interface of the following models is not supported:\n"
"\n"
